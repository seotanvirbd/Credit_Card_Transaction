## üîß Implementation Details

### Data Import Process
```sql
-- Example SQL query for data import
CREATE TABLE cc_detail (
    Client_Num INT,
    Card_Category VARCHAR(20),
    -- ... other columns
);

COPY cc_detail
FROM '/path/to/credit_card.csv' 
DELIMITER ',' 
CSV HEADER;
```

### DAX Queries for Advanced Metrics
```dax
Revenue = 'public cc_detail'[annual_fees] + 'public cc_detail'[total_trans_amt] + 'public cc_detail'[interest_earned]

Current_week_Reveneue = CALCULATE(
    SUM('public cc_detail'[Revenue]),
    FILTER(
        ALL('public cc_detail'),
        'public cc_detail'[week_num2] = MAX('public cc_detail'[week_num2])
    )
)
```
# SQL and DAX Queries for Credit Card Analysis

This document contains the SQL queries used for data import and the DAX formulas used in Power BI for advanced calculations in our credit card analysis project.

## SQL Queries

### Creating the Database

```sql
-- Create a database 
CREATE DATABASE ccdb;
```

### Creating Tables

#### Credit Card Details Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE cc_detail (
    Client_Num INT,
    Card_Category VARCHAR(20),
    Annual_Fees INT,
    Activation_30_Days INT,
    Customer_Acq_Cost INT,
    Week_Start_Date DATE,
    Week_Num VARCHAR(20),
    Qtr VARCHAR(10),
    current_year INT,
    Credit_Limit DECIMAL(10,2),
    Total_Revolving_Bal INT,
    Total_Trans_Amt INT,
    Total_Trans_Ct INT,
    Avg_Utilization_Ratio DECIMAL(10,3),
    Use_Chip VARCHAR(10),
    Exp_Type VARCHAR(50),
    Interest_Earned DECIMAL(10,3),
    Delinquent_Acc VARCHAR(5)
);
```

#### Customer Details Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE cust_detail (
    Client_Num INT,
    Customer_Age INT,
    Gender VARCHAR(5),
    Dependent_Count INT,
    Education_Level VARCHAR(50),
    Marital_Status VARCHAR(20),
    State_cd VARCHAR(50),
    Zipcode VARCHAR(20),
    Car_Owner VARCHAR(5),

    Personal_Loan VARCHAR(5),
    Contact VARCHAR(50),
    Customer_Job VARCHAR(50),

);
```

### Importing Data

#### Importing Credit Card Details

```sql
COPY cc_detail
FROM '/path/to/credit_card.csv' 
DELIMITER ',' 
CSV HEADER;
```

## DAX Formulas

### Age Group Calculation

```dax
AgeGroup = SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 30, "20-30",
    'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 30 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 40, "30-40",
    'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 40 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 50, "40-50",
    'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 50 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 60, "50-60",
    'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 60, "60+",
    "unknown"
)
```

### Income Group Calculation

```dax
IncomeGroup = SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    'public cust_detail'[income] < 35000, "Low",
    'public cust_detail'[income] >= 35000 && 'public cust_detail'[income] <70000, "Med",
    'public cust_detail'[income] >= 70000, "High",
    "unknown"
)
```

### Week Number Calculation

```dax
week_num2 = WEEKNUM('public cc_detail'[week_start_date])
```

### Revenue Calculation

```dax
Revenue = 'public cc_detail'[annual_fees] + 'public cc_detail'[total_trans_amt] + 'public cc_detail'[interest_earned]
```

### Current Week Revenue Calculation

```dax
Current_week_Reveneue = CALCULATE(
    SUM('public cc_detail'[Revenue]),
    FILTER(
        ALL('public cc_detail'),
        'public cc_detail'[week_num2] = MAX('public cc_detail'[week_num2])
    )
)
```

### Previous Week Revenue Calculation

```dax
Previous_week_Reveneue = CALCULATE(
    SUM('public cc_detail'[Revenue]),
    FILTER(
        ALL('public cc_detail'),
        'public cc_detail'[week_num2] = MAX('public cc_detail'[week_num2])-1
    )
)
```

These queries and formulas form the backbone of our data processing and analysis in the credit card transaction and customer report project. They demonstrate the power of combining SQL for data management and DAX for advanced calculations in Power BI.
